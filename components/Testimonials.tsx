My grandkids have not been easy on it but now it truly looks new. I love it and no one is allowed to eat in It any longer. Thank you so much you did an amazing job! I highly recommend Mr. O Fresh for your car detailing needs & his prices were competitive and more importantly he was willing to do it lol ðŸ¤£",
